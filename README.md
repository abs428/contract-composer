# contract-composer

Compose arbitrary financial contracts using python.

This repository implements the ideas in [this paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/contracts-icfp.pdf) that defines contructs that allow you to compose complex financial contracts. By implementing the precise language described in the paper, we hope to give anyone the ability to ask hypothetical questions about their finances. Combining this with Generative AI would be the next step.
